# nl-query-interface-ml
Developing a script that exposes an API endpoint where admins can input natural language queries (e.g., “Show me the total sales for last month”). The NLP model processes the input, generates a safe SQL query, runs it on the connected database, and returns the response in text, chart, or table formats based on the nature of the data.
